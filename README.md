**Notes**

I decided to forego using the memory game project files provided by Udacity and build my game from scratch. This was probably a mistake as it took much longer than expected.

I wanted to spend more time learning flexbox which cut into time that would have been better spent with the Javascript logic. I may refactor with bootstrap in the future. I need to work more on flexbox.

The Javascript codes needs to be refactored but I have run out of time and the games meets the project rubric. I used `location = location` to refresh the page on the reset, play again, and close elements which kind of feels like a hacky solution but adheres to the project rubric. In the future I would like to refactor this.

The star / bat rating needs to be adjusted because no one could get 3 stars / bats unless very lucky but it meets the rubric. I'LL refactor in the future.

I started by breaking down the project into small chunks or problems. As per the mentors, if I had a problem I looked for answers from various sources such as:
-building a modal - (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ophW7Ask_0&t=550s)
-building a timer -(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAaf7-WuJJQ&t=473s)

I also completed Colt Steele's Web Developer Course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) to fill in gaps.

**Bugs**
-I read that `setInterval` is not an very accurate way to keep time. I did have points where my clock would speed up but I think I have fixed it. This is something to explore in the future.
-Sometimes cards don't flip if the mouse if clicked to quickly.
-TODO images need to scale better at smaller sizes.
